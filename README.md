Unity Scripts from [Daniel Jochem] (https://github.com/DanielJochem)
- Singleton : For use on scripts that are referred to by multiple other scripts, and that only one instance should ever be available.
- Countdown : A basic countdown timer for use in any situation that you would need a countdown.  It also has the option to display the timer on screen.
- Follow Mouse Direct : Moves the GameObject that this script is on, exactly where the mouse is moving.
- Follow Mouse Lerp : Moves the GameObject that this script is on, lerping towards where the mouse is.
- Keyboard Movement : Moves the GameObject that this script is on, via the keyboard. This may also work with controllers, but I do not have one to test with.
- Move To Click : Moves GameObject the last left-clicked clicked position. You can also hold down left-click and it will follow the mouse.
- Camera Controller : 3rd person car-style customisable follow cam
