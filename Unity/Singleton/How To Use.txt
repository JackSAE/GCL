1. Place in your Scripts folder in your Unity Project.

2. For every Singleton script you need in your project, replace MonoBehaviour at the top of the script with SingletonBehaviour<scriptname>. 
   For example, you probably want your GameManager to be a Singleton, as many other scripts will be referring to it to grab variable values, 
   So you would replace MonoBehaviour with SingletonBehaviour<GameManager> at the beginning of your GameManager script.

3. If you are using Singletons, you want to not use any Awake() functions throughout your scripts, stick with Start(). You will also not be using OnDestory() functions.

How to Refer to the now Singleton script:
	There is no need to GetComponent the script in, no need to reference the now-singleton'd script anywhere. 
	Whenever you want to refer to a variable in the script you have now made a Singleton, you will need to enter 'SingletonScript.Instance.varName' (without the apostrophes). 
	Using the example of the GameManager script, to get the 'speed' variable, you would need to type 'GameManager.Instance.speed'.
